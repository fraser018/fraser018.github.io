        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <div>I joined up with EDA because I want to explore my love for technology. I previously worked in TV production in video editing and then later supporting the editing systems and workflows.
          I want to gain actual hard skills in programming and development that I can use to forge my next path but also have a prt to play in the ever changing environment of the internet and connected devices.
          
          To achieve my goal I have realised there are a few areas that I need to work on, mainly to limit my self critisizing and not to compare my abilities to that of others. This ties into another key area of improvment which is time managment.</div>
